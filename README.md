# Developing metadatamanagement

This application was generated using JHipster, you can find documentation and help at https://jhipster.gitub.io.

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. Java: You need to install java 8 sdk on your system.
2. Maven: You need to install maven 3 on your system.
3. [Node.js][]: Node.js and npm (coming with node.js) are required as well. On Ubuntu you should install node using [NVM][] 

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Grunt][] as our build system. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

You should install [Bower][] and [Yoeman][] globally as well:

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-jhipster

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    mvn
    grunt

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.

# Building for production

To optimize the metadatamanagement client for production, run:

    mvn -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Testing

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript` and can be run with:

    grunt test
