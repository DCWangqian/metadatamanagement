# Developing metadatamanagement

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. Java: You need to install java 8 sdk on your system.
2. Maven: You need to install maven 3 on your system.
3. [Node.js][]: Node.js and npm (coming with node.js) are required as well. On Ubuntu you should install node using [NVM][]
4. Mongodb: Mongodb must be running on the default port, on ubuntu you should install it from here https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
5. Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch must be running on its default port. You can download it from here https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

We use [Grunt][] as our build system. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

You should install [Bower][] globally as well:

    npm install -g bower

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    mvn
    grunt

# Building for the dev environment

To optimize the metadatamanagement client for the dev environment, run:

    mvn -Pdev clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

You can build and deploy the jar to the dev environment by running

    mvn -Pdev clean package cf:push-only
